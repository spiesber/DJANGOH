# DJANGOH - version 4.6.21 (05.05.2022)
Monte Carlo simulation for deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering

DJANGOH performs event simulation of neutral and charged current 
lepton nucleon scattering. The program was developed originally 
for deep inelastic electron proton scattering at HERA, but has 
been extended and includes options for muon scattering, heavy 
nuclear targets, elastic scattering and polarized protons. 
The emphasis is put on the inclusion of radiative corrections, 
comprising single soft and hard photon emission and the complete 
set of electroweak 1-loop corrections in the Standard Model. 
Large-mass hadronic final states are generated by an interface 
to LEPTO which simulates QCD effects. Low-mass hadronic final 
states are included by an interface to SOPHIA.
